===============================================================================================================================================

This repository hosts the script files for converting the 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (HAR)](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
into a tidy data set.

The code assumes that the HAR data is unzipped in [5] and that the environment is a UNIX-based system. The '/' characters in [3] will likely have to be
replaced with '\\' characters in order for the script to work correctly in a Windows environment.
